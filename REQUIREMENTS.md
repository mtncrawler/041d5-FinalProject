## Vision
The purpose of this app is to convert handwritten notes into text files for easier storage, access, and manageability. The user will be able to store notes according to categories and groups can be formed to add and share notes within the group.

## Scope
* IN:
  
 - The web app will allow users to upload an image and convert it to text.
 - The web app will allow users to save text from images to different categories.
 - The web app will allow the user to manage different categories for notes.
 - The web app will allow users to register and log in to his/her account.
 - The web app will allow users to manage text notes in categories. 
 - User can edit text from image results.  

* OUT:
 - We will only convert images to English.
  
### MVP
A user can upload an image to convert to text that can be saved to different categories. The user can edit, update, and delete categories for text notes. Users will register for an account and notes/categories will be saved to a database.
### Stretch
 - The website will save images to the user’s account as a reference.
 - The website will offer speech-to-text for saving notes. 
 - The website will be mobile-friendly (responsive)

## Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- The user can upload an image to convert to text.
- The user can add, edit, and delete notes.
- The user can add, edit, and delete category sets for notes.
- The user can register and log in to an account with notes and categories saved to a database.
- The web app will display notes and categories to the user.

### Non-Functional Requirements
* Usability
  - Intuitive Design: The UI will be designed in a way where users do not have to rely on external or extra instructions to use the web app.
  - Clean & Concise: The UI will be uncluttered and easy to follow and understand.
* Testability
  - Unit Tests: CRUD Operations 
  - The site will have a small total number of user “paths” (associated with CRUD operations) which makes it easier to test that each user path works as intended.
  - Unit Tests: Routes, Controllers & Views
